This is an add-on package for weather radar data processing with the BALTRAD 
Toolbox, a k a RAVE.

rb52odim provides functionality for reading LEONARDO/SELEX Rainbow 5 sweep (azi) and
volume (vol) files, merging variables (moments) from different files into a
single PolarScanCore or PolarVolumeCore object for processing, and writing the 
results to ODIM_H5.

rb52odim supports the reading of extended metadata in Rainbow 5 files.

RAVE and its packages can be found at git.baltrad.eu.

This project is structured similarly to RAVE. Although this is a small project,
ie. there may be few files in each directory, the structure is used anyway for 
consistency and to to serve as a template for other add-ons.

rb52odim will install to the same directories as your RAVE installation.

Installation instructions are found in the INSTALL file.
